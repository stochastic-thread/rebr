  @moduledoc """
    Ingest takes the tar files that have been saved to a local directory, and untars them appropriately as specified
    in the docs for arxiv's bulk content interface.
    As of 2016 they have also maintained a very convenient requestor-pays bucket 
    called 'arxiv', available through Amazon AWS S3.
    All 1.4mm pdfs ever uploaded to arxiv are available. We process initial_population by month and by year, which
    matches the .tar archives (the files are chunked by month and by year)

    file contents are parsed into a simple JSON string, with images using a separate microservice, because pdfminer is still only
    available as a python 2 package. This handles the interaction between the database system being used (configurable, but this was built using Elasticsearch)
